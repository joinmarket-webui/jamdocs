# Getting Started

Jam is an interface for JoinMarket[^jm], a special kind of bitcoin software that
focuses on privacy and security. The goal of Jam is to make it easier to improve
the financial privacy of yourself and others.

[^jm]: Jam and JoinMarket are separate projects. For more information on JoinMarket, see the [JoinMarket GitHub Page](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver)

!!! warning
    Both Jam and its documentation are a work in progress. We are writing
    these docs as we progress, out in the open. If you want to help, please
    do!

As mentioned above, Jam uses JoinMarket under the hood. What sets JoinMarket
apart is that it has no single point of failure. It is completely peer-to-peer,
there is no central coordinator, no "doxxic change", no company behind it all,
no marketing department, and no central entity making any money off of it.

All development is done by volunteers. Consequently, please heed the following
warning:

!!! danger
    **Jam is considered beta software.** While JoinMarket is tried and tested, Jam is new and things might break. Use with caution. Please report any issues [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam/issues/new).

## Installation

The easiest way to install Jam is via one of the full-node software solutions
that includes Jam as an app or plug-in. You can also install it manually
