# Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute: testing, sharing ideas, writing
documentation, creating tutorials, and—of course—writing code.


## Say Hello

It doesn't hurt to say hi and connect with the people that are already working
on Jam, or have worked on it in the past.

## Study the Basics

Identity and privacy are complex topics in general, and Bitcoin privacy is
particularly tricky. Make sure to familiarise yourself with the basics before
you get involved.

## Understand the Philosophy

Before you really get going you should understand the philosophy behind Jam and
the foundations it is built upon.

## What to Work On

While a very rough roadmap and some [milestones][milestones] exist, it's usually
best to "scratch your own itch." Found a bug? Fix it! Have a proposal to make
something better? Create an issue! Found a typo? Fix it! Is Jam not available in
your language? Translate it!

It can be daunting to get started, but Jam, like every software project, is just
code & design & text.

**Code**: [review a pull request][pulls] or work on some [open issues][issues].
Small tasks that are relatively easy to do will have the
"[good first issue][good-first-issue]" label.

**Design**: have a look at the [Figma files][figma], comment on them, or propose
a change.

**Text**: if you're good with words and copy editing, or if you want to help to
translate Jam into multiple languages, [join the translation team][translations].

## Just Get Started!

Since all development happens out in the open and there are no gatekeepers,
getting involved is as easy as showing up.

[pull-request][pulls], or join one of the [community calls][calls].

This is a [free and open-source](/software/license) software project and we love
receiving pull-requests, bug reports, ideas, and feedback from everyone. See the
