Jam supports the creation and handling of multiple wallets. However, only one
wallet can be actively used at a time. Wallets are locked when not used. Your
"active" wallet is the one that is currently unlocked.

- Show seed phrase: show the seed phrase of the active wallet
- Lock wallet: lock the wallet that is currently active
- Switch wallet: open another wallet and lock the current one
- Create new wallet: initialize a new, empty wallet
