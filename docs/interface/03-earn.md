### Offer Options

There are two types of offers:

1. Absolute offer
2. Relative offer

When creating an absolute offer, the fee that you are charging others is set in
absolute terms, e.g. as `250 sats`.

When creating a relative offer, the fee that you are charging others is set in
percentage terms, e.g. as `0.03%`.

Make sure to create a Fidelity Bond to increase the chances of your offer being taken.
