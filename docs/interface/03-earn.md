### Fidelity Bonds

Make sure to [create a fidelity bond][fb] to increase the chances of your offer

A fidelity bond is a mechanism which ensures that market actors act honestly. It
is a protection mechanism against [Sybil attacks][sybil]. A fidelity bond makes
the creation of cryptographic identities costly.

Be aware that funds locked in a Fidelity Bond will **not** be included in your offer amount,
so remember to keep additional funds in order to participate as a market maker.
