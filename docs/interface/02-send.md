# Send

Use the 'Send' tab to send funds to a specific address or to one of the jars. 

Jam defaults to
[collaborative transactions][ct] when sending, which enhances your privacy and
security.

Only one jar can be selected to send from.
Only non-frozen funds will be considered for the transaction.

Use the 'Sweep' button in the amount field to empty a single jar.

!!! Warning
    Using the _Sweep_ button to empty a jar can significantly override the set fee limit.
    This is because of the lack of change output.
    The (default) maximum difference is 80%.
    
Use the
[Sweep tab][sweep] to sweep all non-frozen funds of your wallet (all jars) to external
addresses.

## Sending options

You can set several configurations for the transaction at the _Sending options_ dropdown. 
This includes whether to do a collaborative transaction or not (enabled by default), the number of collaborators (default is random from 8 to 10), and the fee settings (collaborator fees and mining fees).

The higher the
number of collaborators, the larger your [anonymity set][anonset], but this will come with higher fees.

After you made your first collaborative transaction with one of your jars as the
recipient, you are ready to earn.
