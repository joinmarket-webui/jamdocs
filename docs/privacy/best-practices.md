# Best Practices

As with every­thing in Bitcoin, taking control of your privacy is
a gradual, step-by-step process. Learning about and imple­menting these
best practices takes patience and respon­si­bility, so do not be
discour­aged if it seems overwhelming at first. Every step, no matter
how small, is a step in the right direction.

## Take Action

The following are action­able steps you can take to increase
your privacy:

-   Self-custody your coins
-   Do not reuse addresses
-   Minimize exposure to KYC (Know Your Customer)
-   Minimize exposure to third parties
-   Run your own node
-   Use the Light­ning Network for small transactions
-   Do not use public block explorers
-   CoinJoin early and often

## Self-custody your coins

Not your keys, not your bitcoin. If someone
else is holding your bitcoin for you, they know every­thing there is to
know about these coins: amounts, trans­ac­tion histo­ries, future
trans­ac­tions, etc. Taking self-custody of your coins is the first and
most essen­tial step.

## Do not reuse addresses

Reusing addresses destroys the privacy of
both the sender and the receiver. It should be avoided at all costs.

## Minimize exposure to KYC

Linking your real-world identity to your
bitcoin addresses is a neces­sary evil in most juris­dic­tions. While
the effec­tive­ness of these regula­tions is question­able, the
impli­ca­tions for regular users are mostly negative as a multi­tude of
data leaks have shown. If you choose to use KYC on- or off-ramps, make
sure that you under­stand the relation­ship between yourself and the
service in question. You are trusting this service with your personal
data, including the future safety of this data. If you still earn
fiat-denom­i­nated income, we recom­mend using one bitcoin-only service
that allows you to execute automatic recur­ring buys on your behalf.
Swan Bitcoin is such a service. If you want to skip KYC entirely, have
a look at [no-KYC only](https://nokyconly.com).

## Minimize exposure to third parties

[Trusted third parties are security
holes](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/). If you can rely on
yourself instead of trusted third parties, you should.

## Run your own node

Not your node, not your rules. Running your own
node is essen­tial to use Bitcoin in a private manner. Every
inter­ac­tion with the Bitcoin network is facil­i­tated by a node. If
you are not in control of this node, whatever you are doing is seen by
the node you are inter­acting with. This means whoever is in control of
the node is able to see what you are doing. This [node
guide](https://bitcoiner.guide/node/) is a great resource to get
you started.

## Use the Light­ning Network for small trans­ac­tions

The off-chain nature of the light­ning network increases the trans­ac­tional
privacy of its users without having to jump through too many hoops. While it is
still early, the absolutely reckless days of the light­ning network are likely
behind us. Using it for small- and medium-sized trans­ac­tions can help improve
both your privacy as well as your fee footprint.

## Do not use public block explorers

Looking up addresses in public
block explorers will link those addresses with your IP, which, in turn,
can be linked to your real identity. Software packages like
[Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/) and [myNode](https://mynodebtc.com/)
make it easy to run your own block explorer. If you have to use a public
block explorer, make sure to mask your IP by connecting to them via
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/), or at least use
a [VPN](https://mullvad.net/).

## CoinJoin early and often

Because Bitcoin is forever, using trans­ac­tional best practices such as
collab­o­ra­tive CoinJoin trans­ac­tions will ensure that your privacy is
protected going forward. While CoinJoin trans­ac­tions are nuanced,
user-friendly software exists to help you create and automate these kinds of
trans­ac­tions. Samourai's [Whirlpool](https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool) is
a good  solution for Android users, for example. There is also JoinMarket,
which, thanks to projects like [JoininBox](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox)
and [Jam](/), can be set up quite easily on your own node.
